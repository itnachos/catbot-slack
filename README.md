# catbot-slack
Cute animal pictures have been scientifically proven to improve productivity in the office. Embrace the power of cute cats, reduce stress, and refresh your team with the best artisanal cat gifs curated by [edgecats.net](https://github.com/flores/moarcats) and up-to-date cat facts from [catfacts-api](http://catfacts-api.appspot.com/).

To use Catbot, deploy the app to your host of choice (automagic heroku deploy button included below), and add a bot integration to your Slack team. Copypasta the bot token from Slack into the BOT_TOKEN environment variable, set the DEBUG variable to either true or false, and you're good to go.
