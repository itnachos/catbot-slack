Cat pictures have been shown to improve productivity in the office. Increase focus, reduce stress, and refresh your team with the best artisanal cat gifs curated by [edgecats.net](https://github.com/flores/moarcats) and up-to-date cat facts from [catfacts-api](http://catfacts-api.appspot.com/).

To use Catbot, deploy the app to your host of choice (or use the automagic heroku deploy button below), and add a bot integration to your Slack team. Copypasta the bot token from Slack into the BOT_TOKEN environment variable, set the DEBUG variable to either true or false, and you're good to go.
